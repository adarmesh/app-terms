FitSchedule: Your Complete Client Scheduling & Tracking Solution
FitSchedule is a comprehensive mobile application designed for professionals who manage client sessions—trainers, coaches, therapists, tutors, and consultants. Built with Expo and React Native, this elegant dark-themed app streamlines the entire process of scheduling, tracking, and managing client sessions.
Core Features:
Smart Calendar System: The app features an intuitive calendar with multiple view modes (day, 3-day, and week views) that displays all scheduled sessions with color coding. Individual sessions appear in purple, while group sessions use customizable colors. The calendar includes infinite horizontal scrolling for seamless navigation and automatically shows a real-time indicator line.
Member Management: Import contacts directly from your phone or add them manually with WhatsApp integration. Each member can have multiple session packages tracked independently, showing total and remaining sessions with color-coded status indicators (green for healthy, orange for low, red for depleted).
Session Tracking: Create session packages for members, tracking how many sessions they've purchased and how many remain. The app automatically deducts sessions when events are marked complete, providing real-time visibility into client balances. Quick WhatsApp access lets you contact members instantly.
Flexible Scheduling: Schedule one-time sessions or create recurring series based on specific weekdays. Support both individual and group sessions, with the latter allowing multiple members to share a single event while each having their sessions tracked independently.
Automated Processing: The app intelligently processes completed events, automatically marking past sessions as complete and deducting from member session counts. Skipped sessions can be marked separately without affecting session balances.
Professional Design: A sleek dark interface with smooth animations, haptic feedback, and an intuitive user experience makes managing dozens of clients effortless. Built with modern React patterns and optimized for performance.
